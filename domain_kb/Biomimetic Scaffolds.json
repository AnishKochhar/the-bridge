    "title": "AI LEGO: Scaffolding Cross-Functional Collaboration in Industrial Responsible AI Practices during Early Design Stages",
    "abstract": "Responsible AI (RAI) efforts increasingly emphasize the importance of addressing potential harms early in the AI development lifecycle through social-technical lenses. However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work is often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of transferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical experts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm identification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8 practitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design choices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by non-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to support mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without scaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google Docs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint harm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to align understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based prototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively facilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the early design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft development plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through stage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface potential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO increased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline worksheets. Participants found that its modular structure and persona prompts made harm identification more accessible, fostering clearer and more collaborative RAI practices in early design."

    "abstract": "In this study, we present a generalized quantum photocell model inspired by biological light-harvesting complexes, designed to probe the influence of donor multiplicity on photovoltaic performance. Building upon earlier two and three-donor systems, we introduce a scalable architecture comprising N independent donor molecules symmetrically arranged around a central acceptor. By modeling the system as a quantum heat engine and solving the master equation under the Born-Markov approximation, we uncover that increasing the number of donors leads to a superlinear enhancement in photocurrent and output power. Specifically, the current does not merely scale linearly with the number of donors but exhibits a marked increase due to collective excitation dynamics and enhanced charge transport. Our results reveal the critical role of donor network topology and aggregation in optimizing quantum photovoltaic efficiency and underscore the potential of biomimetic quantum architectures for next-generation solar energy conversion."

    "abstract": "Generative AI can help small business owners automate tasks, increase efficiency, and improve their bottom line. However, despite the seemingly intuitive design of systems like ChatGPT, significant barriers remain for those less comfortable with technology. To address these disparities, prior work highlights accessory skills -- beyond prompt engineering -- users must master to successfully adopt generative AI including keyboard shortcuts, editing skills, file conversions, and browser literacy. Building on a design workshop series and 15 interviews with small businesses, we introduce BizChat, a large language model (LLM)-powered web application that helps business owners across digital skills levels write their business plan -- an essential but often neglected document. To do so, BizChat's interface embodies three design considerations inspired by learning sciences: ensuring accessibility to users with less digital skills while maintaining extensibility to power users (\"low-floor-high-ceiling\"), providing in situ micro-learning to support entrepreneurial education (\"just-in-time learning\"), and framing interaction around business activities (\"contextualized technology introduction\"). We conclude with plans for a future BizChat deployment."

    "title": "Putting It All into Context: Simplifying Agents with LCLMs",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for automating complex real-world tasks. To make progress on these difficult tasks, LM agent architectures have become increasingly complex, often incorporating multi-step retrieval tools, multiple agents, and scaffolding adapted to the underlying LM. In this work, we investigate whether all of this complexity is necessary, or if parts of these scaffolds can be removed on challenging tasks like SWE-bench. We show that in the case of SWE-bench, simply putting the entire environment into the context of a long context language model (LCLM) and properly prompting the model makes it competitive with carefully tuned, complex agent scaffolds. We show that a Gemini-1.5-Pro model without any scaffolding or tools achieves 38% on SWE-Bench-Verified, comparable with approaches using carefully tuned agent scaffolds (32%). While the unscaffolded approach with Gemini-1.5-Pro falls short of the strongest agentic architectures, we demonstrate that the more capable Gemini-2.5-Pro using the same unscaffolded approach directly attains a 50.8% solve rate. Additionally, a two-stage approach combining Gemini-1.5-Pro with Claude-3.7 achieves a competitive 48.6% solve rate."

    "title": "Unraveling the impact of competing interactions on non-equilibrium colloidal gelation",
    "abstract": "Competing interactions stabilize exotic mesoscopic structures, yet the microscopic mechanisms by which they influence non-equilibrium processes leading to disordered states remain largely unexplored, despite their critical role in self-assembly across a range of nanomaterials and biological systems. Here, we numerically investigate the structural evolution in charged colloidal model systems, where short-range attractions and long-range repulsions compete. We reveal that these two interaction scales drive sequential ordering within clusters, from tetrahedra motifs to linear aggregates with chiral order. This process disrupts early-stage percolated networks, resulting in reentrant behavior -- a dynamic transition from disordered cluster to network to chiral rigid cluster. On the other hand, the cluster-elastic network boundary in the final state is governed by isostatic percolation, which slows structural rearrangements, preserves branching points, and sustains a long-lived network. The resulting structure consist of rigid Bernal spiral-like branches connected through flexible branching points lacking order. These insights advance our microscopic understanding of out-of-equilibrium ordering driven by competing interactions, particularly phenomena like temporally delayed frustration reflecting different length scales of competing interactions. The mechanisms identified here may play a crucial role in mesoscale self-organization across soft materials, from nanoparticle assemblies to biological gels and cytoskeletal networks. Understanding how competing interactions regulate structure and dynamics could guide the design of adaptive materials with tunable mechanical properties and offer new perspectives on biological processes such as cytoplasmic organization and cellular scaffolding."

    "title": "A 3D pocket-aware and evolutionary conserved interaction guided diffusion model for molecular optimization",
    "abstract": "Generating molecules that bind to specific protein targets via diffusion models has shown good promise for structure-based drug design and molecule optimization. Especially, the diffusion models with binding interaction guidance enables molecule generation with high affinity through forming favorable interaction within protein pocket. However, the generated molecules may not form interactions with the highly conserved residues, which are important for protein functions and bioactivities of the ligands. Herein, we developed a new 3D target-aware diffusion model DiffDecip, which explicitly incorporates the protein-ligand binding interactions and evolutionary conservation information of protein residues into both diffusion and sampling process, for molecule optimization through scaffold decoration. The model performance revealed that DiffDecip outperforms baseline model DiffDec on molecule optimization towards higher affinity through forming more non-covalent interactions with highly conserved residues in the protein pocket."

    "title": "Safety by Measurement: A Systematic Literature Review of AI Safety Evaluation Methods",
    "abstract": "As frontier AI systems advance toward transformative capabilities, we need a parallel transformation in how we measure and evaluate these systems to ensure safety and inform governance. While benchmarks have been the primary method for estimating model capabilities, they often fail to establish true upper bounds or predict deployment behavior. This literature review consolidates the rapidly evolving field of AI safety evaluations, proposing a systematic taxonomy around three dimensions: what properties we measure, how we measure them, and how these measurements integrate into frameworks. We show how evaluations go beyond benchmarks by measuring what models can do when pushed to the limit (capabilities), the behavioral tendencies exhibited by default (propensities), and whether our safety measures remain effective even when faced with subversive adversarial AI (control). These properties are measured through behavioral techniques like scaffolding, red teaming and supervised fine-tuning, alongside internal techniques such as representation analysis and mechanistic interpretability. We provide deeper explanations of some safety-critical capabilities like cybersecurity exploitation, deception, autonomous replication, and situational awareness, alongside concerning propensities like power-seeking and scheming. The review explores how these evaluation methods integrate into governance frameworks to translate results into concrete development decisions. We also highlight challenges to safety evaluations - proving absence of capabilities, potential model sandbagging, and incentives for \"safetywashing\" - while identifying promising research directions. By synthesizing scattered resources, this literature review aims to provide a central reference point for understanding AI safety evaluations."

    "abstract": "Parsons problems (PPs) have shown promise in structured problem solving by providing scaffolding that decomposes the problem and requires learners to reconstruct the solution. However, some students face difficulties when first learning with PPs or solving more complex Parsons problems. This study introduces Guided Parsons problems (GPPs) designed to provide step-specific hints and improve learning outcomes in an intelligent logic tutor. In a controlled experiment with 76 participants, GPP students achieved significantly higher accuracy of rule application in both level-end tests and post-tests, with the strongest gains among students with lower prior knowledge. GPP students initially spent more time in training (1.52 vs. 0.81 hours) but required less time for post-tests, indicating improved problem solving efficiency. Our thematic analysis of GPP student self-explanations revealed task decomposition, better rule understanding, and reduced difficulty as key themes, while some students felt the structured nature of GPPs restricted their own way of reasoning. These findings reinforce that GPPs can effectively combine the benefits of worked examples and problem solving practice, but could be further improved by individual adaptation."

    "abstract": "Creative coding platforms like Scratch have democratized programming for children, yet translating imaginative ideas into functional code remains a significant hurdle for many young learners. While AI copilots assist adult programmers, few tools target children in block-based environments. Building on prior research \\cite{druga_how_2021,druga2023ai, druga2023scratch}, we present Cognimates Scratch Copilot: an AI-powered assistant integrated into a Scratch-like environment, providing real-time support for ideation, code generation, debugging, and asset creation. This paper details the system architecture and findings from an exploratory qualitative evaluation with 18 international children (ages 7--12). Our analysis reveals how the AI Copilot supported key creative coding processes, particularly aiding ideation and debugging. Crucially, it also highlights how children actively negotiated the use of AI, demonstrating strong agency by adapting or rejecting suggestions to maintain creative control. Interactions surfaced design tensions between providing helpful scaffolding and fostering independent problem-solving, as well as learning opportunities arising from navigating AI limitations and errors. Findings indicate Cognimates Scratch Copilot's potential to enhance creative self-efficacy and engagement. Based on these insights, we propose initial design guidelines for AI coding assistants that prioritize youth agency and critical interaction alongside supportive scaffolding."

    "title": "Technical Report: Evaluating Goal Drift in Language Model Agents",
    "abstract": "As language models (LMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, their robust adherence to human-assigned objectives becomes crucial for safe operation. When these agents operate independently for extended periods without human oversight, even initially well-specified goals may gradually shift. Detecting and measuring goal drift - an agent's tendency to deviate from its original objective over time - presents significant challenges, as goals can shift gradually, causing only subtle behavioral changes. This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing goal drift in LM agents. In our experiments, agents are first explicitly given a goal through their system prompt, then exposed to competing objectives through environmental pressures. We demonstrate that while the best-performing agent (a scaffolded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet) maintains nearly perfect goal adherence for more than 100,000 tokens in our most difficult evaluation setting, all evaluated models exhibit some degree of goal drift. We also find that goal drift correlates with models' increasing susceptibility to pattern-matching behaviors as the context length grows."

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen unprecedented growth in active matter and autonomous biomaterials research, yielding diverse classes of materials that promise revolutionary applications such as self-healing infrastructure and self-sensing tissue implants. However, inconsistencies in metrics, definitions, and analysis algorithms across research groups, as well as the high-dimension data streams, has hindered identification of performance intersections. Progress in this arena demands multi-disciplinary team approaches to discovery with scaffolded training and cross-pollination of ideas, and requires new learning and collaboration methods. To address this challenge, we have developed a hackathon platform to train future scientists and engineers in big data, interdisciplinary collaboration, and community coding; and to design and beta-test high-throughput (HTP) biomaterials analysis software and workflows. We enforce a flat hierarchy, pairing participants ranging from high school students to faculty with varied experiences and skills to collectively contribute to data acquisition and processing, ideation, coding, testing and dissemination. With clearly-defined goals and deliverables, participants achieve success through a series of tutorials, small group coding sessions, facilitated breakouts, and large group report-outs and discussions. These modules facilitate efficient iterative algorithm development and optimization; strengthen community and collaboration skills; and establish teams, benchmarks, and community standards for continued productive work. Our hackathons provide a powerful model for the soft matter community to educate and train students and collaborators in cutting edge data-driven analysis, which is critical for future innovation in complex materials research."

    "abstract": "Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering computer science education, yet its effects on student learning, skill development, and perceptions remain underexplored. Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on structured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines the impact of a dedicated \"AI-Lab\" intervention -- emphasizing guided scaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data Structures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering courses at Purdue University. Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and elective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey responses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as well as qualitative narratives of student experiences. While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting students' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention \"bridged the gap\" between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools into coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill development. These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable students to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential competencies. We offer evidence-based recommendations for educators seeking to integrate GenAI responsibly into computing curricula and identify avenues for future research on GenAI-supported pedagogy."

    "abstract": "We reformulate tree-level amplitudes in open superstring theory (type-I) in terms of stringy Tr$(\\phi^3)$ amplitudes with various kinematical shifts in the \"curve-integral\" formulation: while the bosonic-string amplitude with $n$ pairs of \"scaffolding\" scalars comes from a particularly simple shift of the Tr$(\\phi^3)$ one (corresponding to $n$ length-$2$ cycles), the analogous superstring amplitude requires \"correction\" terms given by bosonic-string amplitudes with longer, even-length \"cycles\", which are also Tr$(\\phi^3)$ ones at shifted kinematics dictated by the cycles; in total it is expressed as a sum of $(2n{-}3)!!$ shifted amplitudes originated from the expansion of a reduced Pfaffian. Upon taking $n$ scaffolding residues, this leads to a new formula of the $n$-gluon superstring amplitude, which is manifestly symmetric in $n{-}1$ legs, as a gauge-invariant combination of mixed bosonic string amplitudes with gluons and scalars, which come from length-$2$ cycles and longer ones respectively (the total sum is associated with the expansion a $n\\times n$ symmetrical determinant); the corresponding prefactors are nested commutators of $2n$-gon kinematical variables, which nicely become traces of field-strengths for those legs corresponding to scalars in the mixed amplitudes. These interesting linear combinations of bosonic string amplitudes must guarantee the cancellation of tachyon poles and $F^3$ vertices ${\\it etc.}$, and they give new relations between the superstring amplitude and its bosonic-string building blocks to all orders in the $\\alpha'$ expansion (the first order gives a new formula for gluon amplitudes with a single $F^3$ insertion in terms of Yang-Mills-scalar amplitudes). We provide both the worldsheet and \"curve-integral\" derivations, and discuss applications to heterotic and type II cases."

We close this gap with TF1-EN-3M, the first open dataset of three million English-language fables generated exclusively by instruction-tuned models no larger than 8B parameters. Each story follows a six-slot scaffold (character -> trait -> setting -> conflict -> resolution -> moral), produced through a combinatorial prompt engine that guarantees genre fidelity while covering a broad thematic space. A hybrid evaluation pipeline blends (i) a GPT-based critic that scores grammar, creativity, moral clarity, and template adherence with (ii) reference-free diversity and readability metrics. Among ten open-weight candidates, an 8B-parameter Llama-3 variant delivers the best quality-speed trade-off, producing high-scoring fables on a single consumer GPU (<24 GB VRAM) at approximately 13.5 cents per 1,000 fables. We release the dataset, generation code, evaluation scripts, and full metadata under a permissive license, enabling exact reproducibility and cost benchmarking. TF1-EN-3M opens avenues for research in instruction following, narrative intelligence, value alignment, and child-friendly educational AI, demonstrating that large-scale moral storytelling no longer requires proprietary giant models."

Since understanding depends on the explainee's background and needs, recent research has focused on co-constructive explanation dialogues, where the explainer continuously monitors the explainee's understanding and adapts explanations dynamically. We investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage as explainers in co-constructive explanation dialogues. In particular, we present a user study in which explainees interact with LLMs, of which some have been instructed to explain a predefined topic co-constructively. We evaluate the explainees' understanding before and after the dialogue, as well as their perception of the LLMs' co-constructive behavior. Our results indicate that current LLMs show some co-constructive behaviors, such as asking verification questions, that foster the explainees' engagement and can improve understanding of a topic. However, their ability to effectively monitor the current understanding and scaffold the explanations accordingly remains limited."

    "abstract": "Language models prompted with a user description or persona can predict a user's preferences and opinions, but existing approaches to building personas -- based solely on a user's demographic attributes and/or prior judgments -- fail to capture the underlying reasoning behind said user judgments. We introduce PB&J (Psychology of Behavior and Judgments), a framework that improves LLM personas by incorporating rationales of why a user might make specific judgments. These rationales are LLM-generated, and aim to reason about a user's behavior on the basis of their experiences, personality traits or beliefs. This is done using psychological scaffolds -- structured frameworks grounded in theories such as the Big 5 Personality Traits and Primal World Beliefs -- that help provide structure to the generated rationales. Experiments on public opinion and movie preference prediction tasks demonstrate that LLM personas augmented with PB&J rationales consistently outperform methods using only a user's demographics and/or judgments. Additionally, LLM personas constructed using scaffolds describing user beliefs perform competitively with those using human-written rationales."

We propose a two-stage framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized LLaMA model achieved a relative 33.9\\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL tasks, while Qwen achieved a relative 14.5\\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data."

This paper presents Cognitive Silicon: a hypothetical full-stack architectural framework projected toward 2035, exploring a possible trajectory for cognitive computing system design. The proposed architecture would integrate symbolic scaffolding, governed memory, runtime moral coherence, and alignment-aware execution across silicon-to-semantics layers. Our design grammar has emerged from dialectical co-design with LLMs under asymmetric epistemic conditions--creating structured friction to expose blind spots and trade-offs. The envisioned framework would establish mortality as a natural consequence of physical constraints, non-copyable tacit knowledge, and non-cloneable identity keys as cognitive-embodiment primitives. Core tensions (trust/agency, scaffolding/emergence, execution/governance) would function as central architectural pressures rather than edge cases. The architecture theoretically converges with the Free Energy Principle, potentially offering a formal account of how cognitive systems could maintain identity through prediction error minimization across physical and computational boundaries. The resulting framework aims to deliver a morally tractable cognitive infrastructure that could maintain human-alignment through irreversible hardware constraints and identity-bound epistemic mechanisms resistant to replication or subversion."

For the first time, our method enables deep neural networks to retain high performance on novel tasks while maintaining prior knowledge in real-world challenging continual learning scenarios, e.g., class-incremental learning on ImageNet. This study demonstrates that emulating biological intelligence provides a promising path to enable deep neural networks with continual learning capabilities."

We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall, our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy, and safe deployment."

Questions remain about leveraging synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains. A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple \"expert\" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM pre-training corpora. Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth."

We present Schemex, an interactive visual workflow that scaffolds schema induction through clustering, abstraction, and contrastive refinement. Schemex supports users through visual representations and interactive exploration that connect abstract structures to concrete examples, promoting transparency, adaptability, and effective human-AI collaboration. In our user study, participants reported significantly greater insight and confidence in the schemas developed with Schemex compared to those created using a baseline of an AI reasoning model. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of structural abstraction and contrastive refinement across domains."

    "abstract": "In this article, we attempt to make a conceptual bridge between the research in biology, pre-biotic chemistry, biomimetics, and the tools used in organic bioelectronics in terms of materials and devices. The goal is discussing how materials and devices of organic bioelectronics can be exploited and used at the interface with biology, but also how, and at what extent, they can be adapted to mimicking nature-inspired properties, herein including unconventional computing strategies. The idea is to provide new hints and solid hypotheses for designing niche experiments that could benefit from a proper interaction, even at a basic communicative level, between materials science and biotechnology. The finale long-term vision goal being the vision of collecting experimental data that may help to made a step forward toward the implementation of the transition from inanimate objects to animated beings. The mathematical model canonically considered in this work is the Navier-Stokes-Nernst-Planck (NPNS) Model which is often used to model a charged continuum system such as the organic electrochemical transistors."

    "title": "Refractive Index Engineering: Insights from Biological Systems for Advanced Optical Design",
    "abstract": "This review explores the innovative design to achieve advanced optical functions in natural materials and intricate optical systems inspired by the unique refractive index profiles found in nature. By understanding the physical principles behind biological structures, we can develop materials with tailored optical properties that mimic these natural systems. One key area discussed is biomimetic materials design, where biological systems such as apple skin and the vision system inspire new materials. Another focus is on intricate optical systems based on refractive index contrast. These principles can be extended to design devices like waveguides, photonic crystals, and metamaterials, which manipulate light in novel ways. Additionally, the review covers optical scattering engineering, which is crucial for biomedical imaging. By adjusting the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index, we can control how much light is scattered and absorbed by tissues. This is particularly important for techniques like optical coherence tomography and multiphoton microscopy, where tailored scattering properties can improve imaging depth and resolution. The review also discusses various techniques for measuring the refractive index of biological tissues which provide comprehensive insights into the optical properties of biological materials, facilitating the development of advanced biomimetic designs. In conclusion, the manipulation of refractive index profiles in biological systems offers exciting opportunities for technological advancements. By drawing inspiration from nature and understanding the underlying physical principles, we can create materials and devices with enhanced performance and new functionalities. Future research should focus on further exploring these principles and translating them into practical applications to address real-world challenges."

    "title": "Exploring Student Behaviors and Motivations using AI TAs with Optional Guardrails",
    "abstract": "AI-powered chatbots and digital teaching assistants (AI TAs) are gaining popularity in programming education, offering students timely and personalized feedback. Despite their potential benefits, concerns about student over-reliance and academic misconduct have prompted the introduction of \"guardrails\" into AI TAs - features that provide scaffolded support rather than direct solutions. However, overly restrictive guardrails may lead students to bypass these tools and use unconstrained AI models, where interactions are not observable, thus limiting our understanding of students' help-seeking behaviors. To investigate this, we designed and deployed a novel AI TA tool with optional guardrails in one lab of a large introductory programming course. As students completed three code writing and debugging tasks, they had the option to receive guardrailed help or use a \"See Solution\" feature which disabled the guardrails and generated a verbatim response from the underlying model. We investigate students' motivations and use of this feature and examine the association between usage and their course performance. We found that 50% of the 885 students used the \"See Solution\" feature for at least one problem and 14% used it for all three problems. Additionally, low-performing students were more likely to use this feature and use it close to the deadline as they started assignments later. The predominant factors that motivated students to disable the guardrails were assistance in solving problems, time pressure, lack of self-regulation, and curiosity. Our work provides insights into students' solution-seeking motivations and behaviors, which has implications for the design of AI TAs that balance pedagogical goals with student preferences."

    "abstract": "The limited reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) cast doubt on their suitability for tasks demanding deep, multi-step logical deduction. This paper introduces a framework called Small Reasons, Large Hints (SMART), which selectively augments SLM reasoning with targeted guidance from large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the concept of cognitive scaffolding, SMART employs a score-based evaluation to identify uncertain reasoning steps and injects corrective LLM-generated reasoning only when necessary. By framing structured reasoning as an optimal policy search, our approach steers the reasoning trajectory toward correct solutions without exhaustive sampling. Our experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that targeted external scaffolding significantly improves performance, paving the way for collaborative use of both SLM and LLM to tackle complex reasoning tasks that are currently unsolvable by SLMs alone."

    "title": "Designing Child-Friendly AI Interfaces: Six Developmentally-Appropriate Design Insights from Analysing Disney Animation",
    "abstract": "To build AI interfaces that children can intuitively understand and use, designers need a design grammar that truly serves children's developmental needs. This paper bridges Artificial Intelligence design for children -- an emerging field still defining its best practices -- and children's animation, a well-established field with decades of experience in engaging young viewers through emotionally resonant, cognitively accessible storytelling. Pairing Piagetian developmental theory with design pattern extraction from 52 works of Disney animation, the paper presents six design insights transferable to child-centred AI interface design: (1) emotional expressiveness and visual clarity, (2) musical and auditory scaffolding, (3) audiovisual synchrony for emotional comfort, (4) sidekick-style personas, (5) support for symbolic play and imaginative exploration, and (6) predictable and scaffolded interaction structures. These strategies -- long refined in Disney animation -- function as multimodal scaffolds for attention, understanding, and emotional attunement, thereby forming a structured design grammar familiar to children and transferable to AI interface design. By reframing cinematic storytelling as design logic for AI, the paper offers heuristics for crafting intuitive AI interfaces that align with children's cognitive stages and emotional needs. The work contributes to design theory by showing how sensory, affective and narrative techniques can inform developmentally attuned AI design for children. Future directions include empirical testing, cultural adaptation, and participatory co-design."

    "title": "Connecting Feedback to Choice: Understanding Educator Preferences in GenAI vs. Human-Created Lesson Plans in K-12 Education -- A Comparative Analysis",
    "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) models are increasingly explored for educational applications, understanding educator preferences for AI-generated lesson plans is critical for their effective integration into K-12 instruction. This exploratory study compares lesson plans authored by human curriculum designers, a fine-tuned LLaMA-2-13b model trained on K-12 content, and a customized GPT-4 model to evaluate their pedagogical quality across multiple instructional measures: warm-up activities, main tasks, cool-down activities, and overall quality. Using a large-scale preference study with K-12 math educators, we examine how preferences vary across grade levels and instructional components. We employ both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The raw preference results indicate that human-authored lesson plans are generally favored, particularly for elementary education, where educators emphasize student engagement, scaffolding, and collaborative learning. However, AI-generated models demonstrate increasing competitiveness in cool-down tasks and structured learning activities, particularly in high school settings. Beyond quantitative results, we conduct thematic analysis using LDA and manual coding to identify key factors influencing educator preferences. Educators value human-authored plans for their nuanced differentiation, real-world contextualization, and student discourse facilitation. Meanwhile, AI-generated lesson plans are often praised for their structure and adaptability for specific instructional tasks. Findings suggest a human-AI collaborative approach to lesson planning, where GenAI can serve as an assistive tool rather than a replacement for educator expertise in lesson planning. This study contributes to the growing discourse on responsible AI integration in education, highlighting both opportunities and challenges in leveraging GenAI for curriculum development."

    "title": "Ionomeric extracellular matrices for dynamic soft robotic tissue engineering devices through protein sulfonation",
    "abstract": "Conventional tissue engineering methodologies frequently depend on pharmacological strategies to induce or expedite tissue repair. However, bioengineered strategies incorporating biophysical stimulation have emerged as promising alternatives. Electroactive materials facilitate the provision of controlled electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical stimuli, which support cell proliferation and tissue remodelling. Despite their ability to supply external electrical and mechanical stimuli to the tissue microenvironment, the electroactive polymers in use today often lack critical biochemical signals essential for native-like cell-cell and cell-scaffold interactions, thereby constraining their regenerative capabilities. To address the demand for biomimetic materials that possess enhanced capabilities in promoting cell and tissue stimulation, we present the development of a novel class of polymers called ionomeric extracellular matrices (iECMs). By utilising the linker-mediated conjugation of sulfonic acid biomolecules (taurine) to the backbone of an extracellular matrix protein (collagen), we illustrate the potential of iECMs as the first electromechanical actuating material platform derived entirely from ECM materials, paving the way for dynamic and soft-robotic platforms for a wide range of tissue engineering applications."

    "title": "Supporting Students' Reading and Cognition with AI",
    "abstract": "With the rapid adoption of AI tools in learning contexts, it is vital to understand how these systems shape users' reading processes and cognitive engagement. We collected and analyzed text from 124 sessions with AI tools, in which students used these tools to support them as they read assigned readings for an undergraduate course. We categorized participants' prompts to AI according to Bloom's Taxonomy of educational objectives -- Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating. Our results show that ``Analyzing'' and ``Evaluating'' are more prevalent in users' second and third prompts within a single usage session, suggesting a shift toward higher-order thinking. However, in reviewing users' engagement with AI tools over several weeks, we found that users converge toward passive reading engagement over time. Based on these results, we propose design implications for future AI reading-support systems, including structured scaffolds for lower-level cognitive tasks (e.g., recalling terms) and proactive prompts that encourage higher-order thinking (e.g., analyzing, applying, evaluating). Additionally, we advocate for adaptive, human-in-the-loop features that allow students and instructors to tailor their reading experiences with AI, balancing efficiency with enriched cognitive engagement. Our paper expands the dialogue on integrating AI into academic reading, highlighting both its potential benefits and challenges."

    "abstract": "Formulating research questions is a foundational yet challenging academic skill, one that generative AI systems often oversimplify by offering instant answers at the expense of student reflection. This protocol lays out a study grounded in constructivist learning theory to evaluate a novel AI-based Socratic Tutor, designed to foster cognitive engagement and scaffold research question development in higher education. Anchored in dialogic pedagogy, the tutor engages students through iterative, reflective questioning, aiming to promote System 2 thinking and counteract overreliance on AI-generated outputs. In a quasi-experimental design, approximately 80 German pre-service biology teacher students will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: an AI Socratic Tutor condition and an uninstructed chatbot control. Across multiple cycles, students are expected to formulate research questions based on background texts, with quality assessed through double-blind expert review. The study also examines transfer of skills to novel phenomena and captures student perceptions through mixed-methods analysis, including surveys, interviews and reflective journals. This study aims to advance the understanding of how generative AI can be pedagogically aligned to support, not replace, human cognition and offers design principles for human-AI collaboration in education."

This work presents a critical review of the impact of low-temperature plasma treatment on enhancing cell adhesion, with emphasis on the physicochemical changes induced on the surface of polymers commonly used in biomedical applications. The mechanisms of interaction between reactive plasma species and the polymer surface are analyzed, along with techniques used to introduce hydrophilic functional groups that improve wettability and biocompatibility. Scientific evidence demonstrates that this type of surface modification promotes greater cell spreading, anchorage, and proliferation, making it particularly useful in the design of tissue engineering scaffolds, implantable devices, and vascular prostheses. Finally, current and future trends in the development of smart plasma-functionalized biomaterials are discussed, highlighting their role in regenerative medicine."

    "abstract": "We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring dynamics and show how the observed states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase separating mixtures."

Agents must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch, including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, we develop rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains 8,316 individually gradable tasks. Rubrics are co-developed with the author(s) of each ICML paper for accuracy and realism. To enable scalable evaluation, we also develop an LLM-based judge to automatically grade replication attempts against rubrics, and assess our judge's performance by creating a separate benchmark for judges. We evaluate several frontier models on PaperBench, finding that the best-performing tested agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) with open-source scaffolding, achieves an average replication score of 21.0%. Finally, we recruit top ML PhDs to attempt a subset of PaperBench, finding that models do not yet outperform the human baseline.

The participants were 28 Chinese university students with prior music instrumental experiences. In an online experiment, they were assigned to either an experimental group, which engaged in music analysis with the teachable agent, or a control group, which conducted self-directed analysis using instructional materials. Findings indicate that students in the experimental group achieved significantly higher post-test scores than those in the control group. Additionally, they reported lower cognitive load, suggesting that the teachable agent effectively reduced the cognitive demands of music analysis tasks. These results highlight the potential of AI-driven scaffolding based on LBT principles to enhance music theory education, supporting teachers in delivering theory-oriented instruction while fostering students' self-directed learning skills."

    "abstract": "Human action recognition in low-light environments is crucial for various real-world applications. However, the existing approaches overlook the full utilization of brightness information throughout the training phase, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose OwlSight, a biomimetic-inspired framework with whole-stage illumination enhancement to interact with action classification for accurate dark video human action recognition. Specifically, OwlSight incorporates a Time-Consistency Module (TCM) to capture shallow spatiotemporal features meanwhile maintaining temporal coherence, which are then processed by a Luminance Adaptation Module (LAM) to dynamically adjust the brightness based on the input luminance distribution. Furthermore, a Reflect Augmentation Module (RAM) is presented to maximize illumination utilization and simultaneously enhance action recognition via two interactive paths. Additionally, we build Dark-101, a large-scale dataset comprising 18,310 dark videos across 101 action categories, significantly surpassing existing datasets (e.g., ARID1.5 and Dark-48) in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed OwlSight achieves state-of-the-art performance across four low-light action recognition benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms previous best approaches by 5.36% on ARID1.5 and 1.72% on Dark-101, highlighting its effectiveness in challenging dark environments."

    "title": "NeuralGS: Bridging Neural Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting for Compact 3D Representations",
    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) demonstrates superior quality and rendering speed, but with millions of 3D Gaussians and significant storage and transmission costs. Recent 3DGS compression methods mainly concentrate on compressing Scaffold-GS, achieving impressive performance but with an additional voxel structure and a complex encoding and quantization strategy. In this paper, we aim to develop a simple yet effective method called NeuralGS that explores in another way to compress the original 3DGS into a compact representation without the voxel structure and complex quantization strategies. Our observation is that neural fields like NeRF can represent complex 3D scenes with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using only a few megabytes. Thus, NeuralGS effectively adopts the neural field representation to encode the attributes of 3D Gaussians with MLPs, only requiring a small storage size even for a large-scale scene. To achieve this, we adopt a clustering strategy and fit the Gaussians with different tiny MLPs for each cluster, based on importance scores of Gaussians as fitting weights. We experiment on multiple datasets, achieving a 45-times average model size reduction without harming the visual quality. The compression performance of our method on original 3DGS is comparable to the dedicated Scaffold-GS-based compression methods, which demonstrate the huge potential of directly compressing original 3DGS with neural fields."

    "title": "AH-GS: Augmented 3D Gaussian Splatting for High-Frequency Detail Representation",
    "abstract": "The 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) is a novel method for scene representation and view synthesis. Although Scaffold-GS achieves higher quality real-time rendering compared to the original 3D-GS, its fine-grained rendering of the scene is extremely dependent on adequate viewing angles. The spectral bias of neural network learning results in Scaffold-GS's poor ability to perceive and learn high-frequency information in the scene. In this work, we propose enhancing the manifold complexity of input features and using network-based feature map loss to improve the image reconstruction quality of 3D-GS models. We introduce AH-GS, which enables 3D Gaussians in structurally complex regions to obtain higher-frequency encodings, allowing the model to more effectively learn the high-frequency information of the scene. Additionally, we incorporate high-frequency reinforce loss to further enhance the model's ability to capture detailed frequency information. Our result demonstrates that our model significantly improves rendering fidelity, and in specific scenarios (e.g., MipNeRf360-garden), our method exceeds the rendering quality of Scaffold-GS in just 15K iterations."

However, generating visual narratives that are faithful to the input text and self-consistent across generated images remains an open challenge, due to the lack of knowledge constraints used for planning the stories. In this work, we propose a new benchmark, VinaBench, to address this challenge. Our benchmark annotates the underlying commonsense and discourse constraints in visual narrative samples, offering systematic scaffolds for learning the implicit strategies of visual storytelling. Based on the incorporated narrative constraints, we further propose novel metrics to closely evaluate the consistency of generated narrative images and the alignment of generations with the input textual narrative. Our results across three generative vision models demonstrate that learning with VinaBench's knowledge constraints effectively improves the faithfulness and cohesion of generated visual narratives."

A standard submission format for genome assemblies is a fasta file giving the sequence of contigs along with an AGP file showing how these components are assembled into larger pieces like scaffolds or chromosomes. For this reason, many scaffolding software pipelines output assemblies in this format. However, although many programs for assembling and scaffolding genomes read and write this format, there is currently no published software for making edits to AGP files when performing assembly curation. We present agptools, a suite of command-line programs that can perform common operations on AGP files, such as breaking and joining sequences, inverting pieces of assembly components, assembling contigs into larger sequences based on an AGP file, and transforming between coordinate systems of different assembly layouts. Additionally, agptools includes an API that writers of other software packages can use to read, write, and manipulate AGP files within their own programs. Agptools gives bioinformaticians a simple, robust, and reproducible way to edit genome assemblies that avoids the shortfalls of other methods for editing AGP files."

    "abstract": "Fifth-generation organic light-emitting diodes exhibit delayed fluorescence even at low temperatures, enabled by exothermic reverse intersystem crossing from a negative singlet-triplet gap (STG), where the first excited singlet lies anomalously below the triplet. This phenomenon -- termed delayed fluorescence from inverted singlet and triplet states (DFIST) -- has been experimentally confirmed only in two triangular molecules with a 12-annulene periphery and a central nitrogen atom. Here, we report a high-throughput virtual screening of 30,797 BN-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons derived from 77 parent scaffolds (2--6 rings). Using a multi-level workflow combining structural stability criteria with accurate L-CC2 excited-state calculations, we identify 72 heteroaromatic candidates with STGs$<0$. Notably, this includes BN-helicenes, where inversion arises from through-space charge-transfer states. Several systems exhibit non-zero oscillator strengths, supporting their potential as fluorescent emitters. Our findings reveal new design motifs for DFIST beyond known frameworks, expanding the chemical space for next-generation emitters based on heteroatom-embedded aromatic systems."
