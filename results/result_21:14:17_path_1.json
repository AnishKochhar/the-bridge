The mechanism involves the principle of self-assembly, which is a fundamental process in biological systems, as seen in cytoskeletal networks that exhibit self-healing properties through active crosslinking (Active Healing of Microtubule-Motor Networks). The hypothesis draws parallels with chitin, a component of the cuticle, implying that similar self-assembly processes can be harnessed to improve mechanical properties like hardness.
